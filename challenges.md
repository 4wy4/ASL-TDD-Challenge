# Challenges Faced

* How to record a call (Android bans this because it's illegal.)
 * We just gave up and held it to the mic.
* Baudot code is a simple one way binary stream. Problem is it's represented by audio. How do we translate from audio to the Baudot signal?

# To Do

* Find a way to stream to Bluetooth for the demo.
